## Things I Was Interested In This Semester

During this entire semester for computers, I really wanted to try to make my own website to see if I would enjoy doing something like that for a job for my future. It happened on two occasions during this semester. The first being for the 20Time project, and the second time being on GitHub (This project right here!)

I was also Interested in making my own game during this semester but later decided that making the actuall game would take way to much time and energy to make. I wouldn't have the website done by the end of the semester in other words. Overall I found this entire course to be Interesting and a different experience.

### Things That I Was Proud Of

During This Semester I did plenty of work on Khan Academy where I found I did my majority of work. I prefered watching the videos and doing the challenges/ Quizzes after the videos as I found it helped me learn / experience how to do that code a bit better. Some of these projects that I was proud of would be (in order)

1. Project Build A House
2. Project Mountain Range
3. Project Paint Splatter
4. Project Memory++
5. Project Design A Store Database

I was proud of these projects specificly as they took me a bit more time than the other projects to do figure out. One I did though I felt very achieved. It was a gerat feeling overcomming them. 

### Things I Will Be Doing Of In The Future

In the future I want to look into getting into Internet Security as it will almost always be a job that will be needed, and seems kinda interesting to me. I also wasnt to look into game programming as I've always been a pretty big gamer loving big gaming titles such as Overwatch, Counter Strike, and some smaller titles such as Golf It. I always wanted to try to make my own game that I would like and maybe some others as well.
